\title{Merge Overlapping Values for Employment Periods}
\usage{
merge_overlapping_values(segments_with_columns, columns)
}
\arguments{
\item{segments_with_columns}{A data.table containing the output from
merge_original_columns(), which includes temporal segments with merged columns.
Must contain 'cf', 'arco' columns and be ordered by person and time.}

\item{columns}{Character vector specifying which columns to process for
overlapping periods. These columns must exist in segments_with_columns.}
}
\value{
A data.table with the same structure as the input, but with overlapping
  period values merged according to data type rules. All other columns and
  rows remain unchanged.
}
\description{
Processes merged segment data to handle overlapping employment periods (arco > 1)
by combining values from the previous row according to data type-specific rules.
This function operates on the output from merge_original_columns() and handles
the merging logic for overlapping employment scenarios.
}
\details{
When employment periods overlap (arco > 1), this function combines values from
the previous row with the current row based on data type:
\itemize{
  \item{\strong{Character/Factor columns}}: Values are combined with "->" separator
        showing transitions (e.g., "CompanyA->CompanyB")
  \item{\strong{Numeric columns}}: Values are summed (e.g., overlapping salaries)
  \item{\strong{Multiple overlaps (arco > 2)}}: Chain all values in sequence for
        characters, continue summing for numerics
  \item{\strong{Factors}}: Converted to character before processing
}

The function processes rows sequentially within each person (cf), looking at the
previous row's value when arco > 1 and merging accordingly. For arco = 1 or 0,
values remain unchanged.

\dontrun{
library(data.table)

# Create sample employment data with overlapping periods
original_dt <- data.table(
  id = 1:3,
  cf = c("PERSON001", "PERSON001", "PERSON001"),

  prior = c(1, 1, 0),
  company = c("CompanyA", "CompanyB", "CompanyC"),
  salary = c(50000, 30000, 25000)
)

# Transform to segments and merge columns
segments <- vecshift(original_dt)
with_columns <- merge_original_columns(original_dt, segments, c("company", "salary"))

# Handle overlapping values
result <- merge_overlapping_values(with_columns, c("company", "salary"))
