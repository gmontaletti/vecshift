\title{Match Events Using Temporal Overlap Strategy (Fully Vectorized)}
\usage{
.match_events_overlap_optimized(
  vecshift_data,
  events_data,
  event_name_column,
  person_id_column,
  progress = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{vecshift_data}{Main employment data with attribute columns initialized}

\item{events_data}{Prepared external events data}

\item{event_name_column}{Event name column (standardized)}

\item{person_id_column}{Person identifier column (standardized)}

\item{progress}{Show progress messages}
}
\value{
Updated vecshift_data with overlap matches, same row count as input (plus synthetics)
}
\description{
Fully vectorized implementation using data.table operations to eliminate
all nested loops. Uses foverlaps() with bulk updates and vectorized case handling
for optimal performance on large datasets.
