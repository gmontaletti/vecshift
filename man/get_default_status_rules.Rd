\title{Default Employment Status Classification Rules}
\usage{
get_default_status_rules()
}
\value{
List with default classification rules containing:
  \itemize{
    \item unemployment: Rules for unemployment periods with duration thresholds
    \item prior_labels: Named list mapping prior values to employment type labels
    \item single_employment: Rules for single employment periods
    \item overlapping_employment: Rules for overlapping employment periods
  }
}
\description{
Returns the default classification rules used by vecshift for employment status.
These rules include flexible prior value mappings and support sequence-based
overlap labeling. The rules can be modified to implement custom business logic.
}
\details{
The default rules include:

**Prior Labels Mapping**: Maps numeric prior values to employment type labels:
* "-1", "0" -> "pt" (part-time)
* "1" -> "ft" (full-time)
* "2" -> "fixed" (fixed-term contract)
* "3" -> "temp" (temporary contract)

**Unemployment Classification**: Based on duration thresholds (8 days default)

**Single Employment**: Creates labels like "occ_ft", "occ_pt", "occ_fixed"

**Overlapping Employment**: Uses sequence-based labeling to create labels
like "over_pt_ft_fixed" based on the chronological sequence of employment
types within the overlapping period.

# View default rules
default_rules <- get_default_status_rules()
print(default_rules)

# Check prior labels mapping
print(default_rules$prior_labels)

# Example: prior value 2 maps to "fixed"
print(default_rules$prior_labels["2"])  # "fixed"
}
