\value{
A ggplot2 object showing overlap patterns
}
\description{
Visualizes patterns of overlapping employment (multiple concurrent jobs),
showing the intensity and duration of overlaps across individuals or time.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Heatmap of overlap intensity
plot_overlap_patterns(data, plot_type = "heatmap")

# Timeline view of overlaps
plot_overlap_patterns(data, plot_type = "timeline", n_people = 10)

# Distribution of overlap levels
plot_overlap_patterns(data, plot_type = "distribution")
