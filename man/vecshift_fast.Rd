\title{Transform Employment Records into Temporal Segments (Fast Version)}
\usage{
vecshift_fast(dt)
}
\arguments{
\item{dt}{A data.table containing employment contract records with the following required columns:
\itemize{
  \item{\code{id}}: Contract identifier (unique key for each employment contract)
  \item{\code{cf}}: Person identifier (e.g., fiscal code)
  \item{\code{INIZIO}}: Contract start date (Date or numeric)
  \item{\code{FINE}}: Contract end date (Date or numeric)
  \item{\code{prior}}: Employment type indicator (0 or negative for part-time, positive for full-time)
}}
}
\value{
A data.table with temporal segments containing:
  \itemize{
    \item{\code{cf}}: Person identifier
    \item{\code{inizio}}: Segment start date
    \item{\code{fine}}: Segment end date
    \item{\code{arco}}: Number of overlapping contracts (0 = unemployment)
    \item{\code{prior}}: Employment type for the segment
    \item{\code{id}}: Contract ID (0 for unemployment periods)
    \item{\code{durata}}: Duration of the segment
    \item{\code{stato}}: Employment status classification:
      \itemize{
        \item{\code{disoccupato}}: Unemployment period (arco = 0)
        \item{\code{occ_ft}}: Single full-time employment
        \item{\code{occ_pt}}: Single part-time employment
        \item{\code{over_pt_ft}}: Overlapping employment, part-time to full-time
        \item{\code{over_ft_pt}}: Overlapping employment, full-time to part-time
        \item{\code{over_pt_pt}}: Overlapping part-time employments
        \item{\code{over_ft_ft}}: Overlapping full-time employments
      }
  }
}
\description{
Processes employment contract records with temporal boundaries to create 
continuous temporal segments that track employment status over time. The function
identifies unemployment periods (when no contracts are active), single employment
periods, and overlapping employment situations.
