\title{Merge Employment Periods with Multiple Consolidation Modes}
\usage{
merge_consecutive_employment(dt, consolidation_type = "both")
}
\arguments{
\item{dt}{A data.table output from vecshift() containing temporal segments with columns:
\itemize{
  \item{\code{cf}}: Person identifier
  \item{\code{inizio}}: Segment start date
  \item{\code{fine}}: Segment end date  
  \item{\code{arco}}: Number of overlapping contracts (0 = unemployment)
  \item{\code{prior}}: Employment type (numeric)
  \item{\code{over_id}}: Overlap identifier (0 = unemployment, >0 = overlapping periods)
  \item{Additional columns}: Any other contract parameters (numeric or character)
}}

\item{consolidation_type}{Character string specifying consolidation approach:
\itemize{
  \item{\code{"both"} (DEFAULT)}: First consolidate overlapping periods (same over_id > 0), 
        then merge consecutive periods. Provides complete employment history consolidation.
  \item{\code{"overlapping"}}: Only consolidate segments with same over_id > 0. 
        Merges simultaneous/overlapping contracts into single periods.
  \item{\code{"consecutive"}}: Only merge periods that are contiguous in time, 
        regardless of over_id. Traditional consecutive period merging.
  \item{\code{"none"}}: No consolidation. Returns original segments unchanged.
}}
}
\value{
A data.table with consolidated employment periods containing:
  \itemize{
    \item{\code{cf}}: Person identifier
    \item{\code{inizio}}: Period start date
    \item{\code{fine}}: Period end date
    \item{\code{arco}}: Number of overlapping contracts (preserved for unemployment)
    \item{\code{prior}}: Duration-weighted mean priority for collapsed periods
    \item{Character columns}: Concatenated as "first->last" for collapsed periods
    \item{Numeric columns}: Duration-weighted mean value for collapsed periods
    \item{Numeric columns with "_direction" suffix}: Direction of change (last - first)
    \item{\code{durata}}: Duration of the period in days
    \item{\code{collapsed}}: Logical indicating if period was collapsed (TRUE) or not (FALSE)
  }
}
\description{
Merges employment periods using different consolidation strategies based on the over_id column
from vecshift() output. The over_id column identifies continuous overlapping employment periods,
enabling sophisticated consolidation approaches for employment history analysis.
