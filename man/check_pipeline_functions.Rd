\title{Check Pipeline Function Availability}
\usage{
check_pipeline_functions()
}
\value{
A named logical vector indicating which functions are available:
  \itemize{
    \item{\code{vecshift}}: Core transformation function
    \item{\code{merge_original_columns}}: Column merging function
    \item{\code{merge_overlapping_values}}: Overlap handling function
    \item{\code{merge_consecutive_employment}}: Period consolidation with over_id
    \item{\code{merge_consecutive_employment_fast}}: Traditional consecutive merging
    \item{\code{validate_over_id_consistency}}: over_id validation
    \item{\code{validate_duration_invariant}}: Duration consistency validation
  }
}
\description{
Utility function to check which pipeline functions are available in the current
environment. This helps users understand what pipeline steps can be executed.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Check which functions are available
availability <- check_pipeline_functions()
print(availability)

# Use availability to conditionally run pipeline steps
if (availability["merge_original_columns"]) {
  # Can safely merge columns
}
}
}
