\title{Transform Employment Records into Temporal Segments (Modular Version)}
\usage{
vecshift(dt, validate = TRUE, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{dt}{A data.table containing employment contract records with the following required columns:
\itemize{
  \item{\code{id}}: Contract identifier (unique key for each employment contract)
  \item{\code{cf}}: Person identifier (e.g., fiscal code)
  \item{\code{INIZIO}}: Contract start date (Date or numeric)
  \item{\code{FINE}}: Contract end date (Date or numeric)
  \item{\code{prior}}: Employment type indicator (0 or negative for part-time, positive for full-time)
}}

\item{validate}{Logical. If TRUE (default), performs input validation. Set to FALSE for performance with validated data.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If TRUE, displays progress messages for large datasets.}
}
\value{
A data.table with temporal segments containing employment status classifications
}
\description{
Processes employment contract records with temporal boundaries to create 
continuous temporal segments that track employment status over time. The function
identifies unemployment periods (when no contracts are active), single employment
periods, and overlapping employment situations.

This is a modular refactoring of the original vecshift function, breaking down
the complex processing into smaller, maintainable components.
