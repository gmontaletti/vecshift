# vecshift Package Migration Guide

## Overview

This guide helps users migrate to vecshift v0.5.0, which introduces significant enhancements centered around the new `over_id` functionality. The `over_id` column provides a unique identifier for continuous overlapping employment periods, enabling more accurate employment transition analysis and improved temporal data processing.

## What's New in v0.5.0

### Core Innovation: over_id Column

The `over_id` column is a breakthrough feature that uniquely identifies continuous employment periods:

- **over_id = 0**: Unemployment periods (no active contracts)
- **over_id > 0**: Employment periods with shared ID for overlapping/continuous contracts
- **Duration Logic**: Ensures elapsed time (`last(FINE) - first(INIZIO) + 1`) equals `sum(durata)` by `cf`

**Key Benefits:**
- **Accurate Transition Analysis**: Distinguish between true job changes vs. contract renewals
- **Precise Unemployment Duration**: Calculate actual time between employment episodes
- **Better Career Progression**: Identify genuine career moves vs. administrative changes
- **Enhanced Consolidation**: Merge overlapping and consecutive periods intelligently

### Major Function Enhancements

1. **`vecshift()`** - Now outputs `over_id` column with corrected duration calculations
2. **`merge_consecutive_employment()`** - New `consolidation_type` parameter with four modes
3. **`analyze_employment_transitions()`** - Consolidation parameters for better transition analysis
4. **Visualization Functions** - Default to consolidated periods for cleaner outputs
5. **Pipeline Functions** - Include consolidation by default

---

## Breaking Changes

### 1. New Required Column: over_id

**Impact**: Functions expecting vecshift output now require the `over_id` column

**What Changed:**
```r
# Before: vecshift output had these columns
c("cf", "inizio", "fine", "arco", "prior", "id", "durata", "stato")

# After: vecshift output includes over_id
c("cf", "inizio", "fine", "arco", "prior", "id", "durata", "stato", "over_id")
```

**Migration Action**: No action required - `over_id` is automatically generated by `vecshift()`

### 2. Duration Calculation Changes

**Impact**: Slightly different duration values due to corrected temporal logic

**What Changed:**
- Duration calculations now ensure temporal consistency
- Overlapping periods have corrected durations that sum to actual elapsed time

**Migration Action**: Review duration-based analyses for consistency

### 3. merge_consecutive_employment() Parameter Changes

**Breaking**: The function signature has changed

```r
# Before: Simple boolean parameter
merge_consecutive_employment(dt, merge_overlapping = TRUE)

# After: Comprehensive consolidation types
merge_consecutive_employment(dt, consolidation_type = "both")
```

**Migration Action**: Update function calls - see [Parameter Mapping](#parameter-mapping) below

---

## New Default Behaviors

### 1. Transition Analysis Functions

**Functions Affected:**
- `analyze_employment_transitions()`
- `plot_transitions_network()`
- `plot_transitions_circular()`
- `plot_transitions_hierarchical()`
- `plot_interactive_transitions()`

**New Defaults:**
- `use_consolidated_periods = TRUE` (was FALSE)
- `consolidation_type = "both"` (comprehensive consolidation)

**Impact**: These functions now provide cleaner, more accurate transition analysis by default

### 2. Pipeline Functions

**Functions Affected:**
- `process_employment_pipeline()`
- Pipeline-based analysis functions

**New Behavior**: Include consolidation in standard pipeline processing

### 3. Visualization Functions

**Impact**: All visualization functions now use consolidated periods by default, resulting in:
- Cleaner network diagrams with fewer artificial nodes
- More accurate transition flows
- Better career progression visualization

---

## Migration Steps

### Step 1: Update Function Calls

#### Basic Users (Main Functions Only)

**No action required** for basic `vecshift()` usage:

```r
# This code continues to work unchanged
result <- vecshift(employment_data)
head(result)  # Now includes over_id column
```

#### Advanced Users (Custom Analysis)

**Update merge_consecutive_employment() calls:**

```r
# Old approach
consolidated <- merge_consecutive_employment(dt, merge_overlapping = TRUE)

# New approach - choose consolidation strategy
consolidated <- merge_consecutive_employment(dt, consolidation_type = "both")
```

### Step 2: Review Analysis Functions

**Update transition analysis to leverage new defaults:**

```r
# Old approach - manual consolidation
transitions <- analyze_employment_transitions(
  pipeline_result = data,
  transition_variable = "company"
)

# New approach - benefits from automatic consolidation
transitions <- analyze_employment_transitions(
  pipeline_result = data,
  transition_variable = "company"
  # use_consolidated_periods = TRUE (default)
  # consolidation_type = "both" (default)
)
```

### Step 3: Verify Visualization Updates

**Most visualization code works unchanged but produces better results:**

```r
# This code works the same but produces cleaner visualizations
plot_transitions_network(transitions, 
                        layout_algorithm = "fr",
                        node_size_variable = "weight")
```

### Step 4: Test Custom Workflows

**Review custom analysis workflows:**

1. **Data Quality**: Check that `over_id` values make sense
2. **Duration Analysis**: Verify duration calculations align with expectations  
3. **Transition Patterns**: Confirm consolidated transitions match business logic

## Before/After Examples

### Example 1: Basic Employment Analysis

**Before (v0.4.x):**
```r
library(vecshift)

# Process employment data
result <- vecshift(employment_data)
print(names(result))
# [1] "cf" "inizio" "fine" "arco" "prior" "id" "durata" "stato"

# Manual consolidation required
consolidated <- merge_consecutive_employment(result, merge_overlapping = TRUE)

# Basic transition analysis
transitions <- analyze_employment_transitions(
  pipeline_result = consolidated,
  transition_variable = "company",
  use_consolidated_periods = FALSE  # Had to manage manually
)
```

**After (v0.5.0):**
```r
library(vecshift)

# Process employment data - now includes over_id
result <- vecshift(employment_data)
print(names(result))
# [1] "cf" "inizio" "fine" "arco" "prior" "id" "durata" "stato" "over_id"

# Intelligent consolidation with multiple strategies
consolidated <- merge_consecutive_employment(result, consolidation_type = "both")

# Enhanced transition analysis with built-in consolidation
transitions <- analyze_employment_transitions(
  pipeline_result = result,  # Can work directly with vecshift output
  transition_variable = "company"
  # use_consolidated_periods = TRUE (automatic)
  # consolidation_type = "both" (comprehensive)
)
```

### Example 2: Career Transition Visualization

**Before (v0.4.x):**
```r
# Manual steps required for clean visualization
result <- vecshift(employment_data)
consolidated <- merge_consecutive_employment(result, merge_overlapping = TRUE) 
transitions <- analyze_employment_transitions(consolidated, "sector")

# Basic visualization
plot_transitions_network(transitions, layout_algorithm = "fr")
```

**After (v0.5.0):**
```r
# Streamlined workflow with better results
result <- vecshift(employment_data)

# Advanced transition analysis with consolidation
transitions <- analyze_employment_transitions(
  pipeline_result = result,
  transition_variable = "sector",
  consolidation_type = "both"  # Overlapping + consecutive
)

# Enhanced visualization with cleaner structure
plot_transitions_network(transitions, 
                        layout_algorithm = "fr",
                        accessibility_mode = TRUE)
```

### Example 3: Custom Analysis Workflow

**Before (v0.4.x):**
```r
# Multiple manual steps
result <- vecshift(employment_data)
employment_only <- result[arco > 0]

# Manual grouping of overlapping periods
# ... complex custom logic ...

# Analysis on manually processed data
analyze_status_patterns(processed_data)
```

**After (v0.5.0):**
```r
# Simplified with over_id
result <- vecshift(employment_data)

# Leverage over_id for sophisticated analysis
employment_analysis <- analyze_status_patterns(
  result, 
  group_by_over_id = TRUE,  # New option
  include_overlaps = TRUE
)

# Built-in consolidation handles complexity
consolidated_patterns <- analyze_temporal_clustering(
  result,
  clustering_variable = "over_id",
  consolidation_type = "overlapping"
)
```

---

## Backward Compatibility

### Maintaining Old Behavior

**To preserve pre-v0.5.0 behavior:**

```r
# Disable consolidation in analysis functions
transitions <- analyze_employment_transitions(
  pipeline_result = data,
  transition_variable = "company",
  use_consolidated_periods = FALSE  # Old behavior
)

# Use minimal consolidation
merged <- merge_consecutive_employment(data, consolidation_type = "none")

# Disable consolidation in visualizations
plot_transitions_network(
  transitions,
  use_consolidated_periods = FALSE  # Explicit old behavior
)
```

### Parameter Mapping

**Old merge_consecutive_employment() to new consolidation_type:**

| Old Parameter | New consolidation_type | Description |
|--------------|----------------------|-------------|
| `merge_overlapping = FALSE` | `"consecutive"` | Only merge consecutive periods |
| `merge_overlapping = TRUE` | `"both"` | Merge overlapping AND consecutive |
| Not available | `"overlapping"` | Only merge overlapping periods |
| Not available | `"none"` | No consolidation |

### Data Compatibility

**vecshift() output compatibility:**

- **Forward Compatible**: New `over_id` column doesn't break existing analyses
- **Additional Information**: Functions that don't use `over_id` continue to work
- **Enhanced Accuracy**: Same analyses produce more accurate results

---

## Recommended Upgrades

### 1. Adopt Comprehensive Consolidation

**Upgrade from basic to comprehensive consolidation:**

```r
# Instead of basic consecutive merging
merge_consecutive_employment(data, consolidation_type = "consecutive")

# Use comprehensive consolidation for better insights
merge_consecutive_employment(data, consolidation_type = "both")
```

**Benefits:**
- More accurate employment episode identification
- Better transition analysis
- Cleaner visualization outputs

### 2. Leverage Enhanced Transition Analysis

**Upgrade transition analysis workflows:**

```r
# Enhanced analysis with unemployment duration limits
transitions <- analyze_employment_transitions(
  pipeline_result = data,
  transition_variable = "company",
  max_unemployment_duration = 365,  # New parameter
  consolidation_type = "both"
)
```

**Benefits:**
- Filter out very long unemployment periods
- Focus on relevant career transitions
- Reduce noise in analysis

### 3. Use Interactive Visualizations

**Upgrade to interactive transition exploration:**

```r
# Static visualization
plot_transitions_network(transitions)

# Interactive exploration with g6r
plot_interactive_transitions(
  transitions,
  layout = "force",
  accessibility_mode = TRUE  # New accessibility features
)
```

**Benefits:**
- Dynamic exploration of transition patterns
- Better accessibility compliance
- Enhanced user interaction

### 4. Implement Advanced Analysis Patterns

**Leverage over_id for sophisticated analysis:**

```r
# Basic employment analysis
basic_patterns <- analyze_status_patterns(data)

# Advanced over_id-based analysis  
advanced_patterns <- analyze_temporal_clustering(
  data,
  clustering_variable = "over_id",
  include_unemployment = TRUE,  # New option
  consolidation_type = "both"
)
```

## Troubleshooting Common Migration Issues

### Issue 1: Missing over_id Column

**Symptom:**
```r
Error: consolidation_type 'both' requires over_id column from vecshift() output
```

**Solution:**
Ensure your data comes from vecshift() v0.5.0:
```r
# Re-run vecshift on original data
result <- vecshift(original_employment_data)

# Then use consolidation functions
consolidated <- merge_consecutive_employment(result, consolidation_type = "both")
```

### Issue 2: Different Duration Values

**Symptom:** Duration calculations differ from previous versions

**Solution:**
1. **Expected**: New duration logic is more accurate
2. **Verify**: Check that total durations sum correctly by person
3. **Update**: Adjust analyses that depend on specific duration values

```r
# Verify duration accuracy
result[, .(total_duration = sum(durata)), by = cf]
# Should match actual employment history length
```

### Issue 3: Visualization Changes

**Symptom:** Network visualizations look different (fewer nodes/edges)

**Solution:**
1. **Expected**: Consolidation produces cleaner visualizations
2. **Revert**: Use `use_consolidated_periods = FALSE` to see old structure
3. **Compare**: Verify new structure reflects true employment patterns

```r
# Compare old vs new visualization structure
plot_old <- plot_transitions_network(transitions, use_consolidated_periods = FALSE)
plot_new <- plot_transitions_network(transitions, use_consolidated_periods = TRUE)
```

### Issue 4: Parameter Deprecation Warnings

**Symptom:** Warnings about deprecated parameters

**Solution:**
Update function calls using the parameter mapping table above:

```r
# Old approach (may generate warnings)
merge_consecutive_employment(data, merge_overlapping = TRUE)

# New approach  
merge_consecutive_employment(data, consolidation_type = "both")
```
